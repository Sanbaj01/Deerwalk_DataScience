#Numpy - Numerical Python
'''
Python Vs C 
Python is slow and productive.
C is fast.
So, Numpy is a mixture of both to maintain productivity and fastness.
Numpy is itself made by C and runs in python.

Statistics
inferential statistics
Differential statistics - mesure of central tendency


Correltion 
-Always between 1 and -1.
> 0.6 positive correlation      
< -0.6 negative correlation
-0.6 between 0.6 does not matter much, very less correlation.

Slope (tanx) --> rate of change

slope of non-linear equation --> Derivative (x^3)



Scalar & Vector
Scalar - when a single unit justifies entire content
Vecotr - collection of 1-D Array (Scalar)

List Vs Arrary
List - elements can be stored anywhere.
Array - elemens are store in contiguous storage(one after another).

# b = {1,2,3,4,'samir',5.5}
# print(b)
